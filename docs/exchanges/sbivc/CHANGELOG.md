# CHANGELOG (append-only)

## Unreleased
- Initial scaffold.

## 2026-02-19
- Added official sources evidence for FAQ/auction/news/top pages.
- Determined API documentation availability as not documented in currently enumerated official pages.
- Left REST/WS/DATA catalog tables without official endpoint/channel/feed specs and recorded evidence URLs in notes.
- Generated `catalog.json` SSOT with empty arrays (`rest_endpoints`/`ws_channels`/`data_feeds`) and verified parse/ID uniqueness checks.

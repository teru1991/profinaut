# CHANGELOG

## 2026-02-19
- Initialized Bitget docs SSOT scaffold under `docs/exchanges/bitget/`.
- Added required files: `README.md`, `sources.md`, `rest-api.md`, `websocket.md`, `fix.md`, `data.md`, `diffs.md`, `catalog.json`, `templates.md`.
- Recorded environment limitation: direct access to required `www.bitget.com` documentation URLs returned HTTP 403 via execution proxy, so endpoint/channel-level extraction and official diff detail extraction are pending connectivity.

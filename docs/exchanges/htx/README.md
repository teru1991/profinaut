# HTX Official Docs Catalog (SSOT)

This directory contains an **official-docs-only** HTX API catalog built from HTX `htx.com` docs/support entrypoints.

## Coverage
- REST: Spot / Margin / Futures / Swap / Options / Earn / Copy / Broker
- WebSocket: Spot / Futures / Swap / Options + common protocol rules
- Diffs: Official change logs / announcements / support updates only

## Notes
- This SSOT includes only information that is explicitly traceable to official HTX URLs listed in `sources.md`.
- If a section is not directly documented in accessible official pages, it is marked `not_applicable` or `unknown` with evidence URLs.

# CHANGELOG (append-only)

## 2026-02-19
- Created `docs/exchanges/binance-coinm/` SSOT set for Binance COIN-M Futures official docs catalog.
- Added source coverage map in `sources.md` for COIN-M REST/WS Streams/WS API/User Data + Derivatives Change Log.
- Added fixed-column catalogs: `rest-api.md`, `websocket.md`, `data.md`, and `diffs.md` (all rows include `source_url` columns).
- Added machine-readable `catalog.json` aligned with markdown IDs.
- Added reusable templates and task README.
- Environment note: direct HTTP retrieval to `developers.binance.com` returned CONNECT 403 during this run; URLs were cataloged from official path conventions only.
- STOP note: what_done = all required deliverables created; what_next = populate `diffs.md` dated COIN-M entries once Change Log page content is retrievable in this environment.

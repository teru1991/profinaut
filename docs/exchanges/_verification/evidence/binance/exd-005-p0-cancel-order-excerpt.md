**Parameters:**

Name              | Type   | Mandatory    | Description
------------      | ------ | ------------ | ------------
symbol            | STRING | YES          |
orderId           | LONG   | NO           |
origClientOrderId | STRING | NO           |
newClientOrderId  | STRING | NO           |  Used to uniquely identify this cancel. Automatically generated by default.
cancelRestrictions| ENUM   | NO           | Supported values: <br>`ONLY_NEW` - Cancel will succeed if the order status is `NEW`.<br> `ONLY_PARTIALLY_FILLED ` - Cancel will succeed if order status is `PARTIALLY_FILLED`.
recvWindow        | DECIMAL| NO           | The value cannot be greater than `60000`. <br> Supports up to three decimal places of precision (e.g., 6000.346) so that microseconds may be specified.
timestamp         | LONG   | YES          |

Notes:
* Either `orderId` or `origClientOrderId` must be sent.
* If both `orderId` and `origClientOrderId` are provided, the `orderId` is searched first, then the `origClientOrderId` from that result is checked against that order. If both conditions are not met the request will be rejected.

**Data Source:**
Matching Engine

**Response:**
```javascript
{
  "symbol": "LTCBTC",
  "origClientOrderId": "myOrder1",
  "orderId": 4,
  "orderListId": -1, // Unless it's part of an order list, value will be -1
  "clientOrderId": "cancelMyOrder1",
  "transactTime": 1684804350068,
  "price": "2.00000000",
  "origQty": "1.00000000",
  "executedQty": "0.00000000",
  "origQuoteOrderQty": "0.000000",
  "cummulativeQuoteQty": "0.00000000",
  "status": "CANCELED",
  "timeInForce": "GTC",
  "type": "LIMIT",
  "side": "BUY",
  "selfTradePreventionMode": "NONE"
}
```

**Notes:**
* The payload above does not show all fields that can appear in the order response. Please refer to [Conditional fields in Order Responses](#conditional-fields-in-order-responses).
* The performance for canceling an order (single cancel or as part of a cancel-replace) is always better when only `orderId` is sent. Sending `origClientOrderId` or both `orderId` + `origClientOrderId` will be slower.

# UCEL Golden Policy — Normalized TOML Verification

Canonical source:
- docs/policy/ucel_golden_policy_pack.md

Normalized outputs:
- docs/policy/ucel_golden/*.toml
- docs/policy/ucel_golden/README.md

Checks:

```bash
ls -la docs/policy/ucel_golden
```

Rule:
- TOML values must be extracted from canonical text only.
- Do not invent values.

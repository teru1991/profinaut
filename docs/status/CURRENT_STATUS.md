# CURRENT_STATUS (Deprecated summary stub)

This file is a non-canonical redirect to avoid stale fixed-value snapshots.

- Runtime status SSOT: `docs/status/status.json`
- For active task, open PRs, locks, and next actions, read `docs/status/status.json` directly.
- Optional human summaries should be generated from current `status.json` values; do not hardcode static placeholders here.

# UG-P0-111 — Reconcile mismatch repair runbook (canary-first)

## Summary
- Added `docs/runbooks/reconcile-mismatch-repair.md` as an operator runbook for handling reconciliation mismatches with a mandatory canary-first recovery flow.
- Documented detection guidance using existing platform endpoints and logs (`/reconcile/results`, `/healthz`, `/capabilities`).
- Added mismatch classification patterns: delay, duplicate, missing, and out-of-order.
- Added safety decision criteria for `SAFE_MODE`, `CLOSE_ONLY`, and `FLATTEN`/`HALT` escalation.
- Added a step-by-step repair loop for safe re-reconciliation and consistency restoration.
- Added canary validation success criteria and explicit rollback procedure when mismatch persists.

## Verification
- Docs-only update; no application/runtime code paths changed.

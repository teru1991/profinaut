# Sample configuration for marketdata collector mock mode
# NOTE: This is an example configuration file. The actual runtime configuration
# is primarily controlled via CLI arguments (--port, --mock, etc.) and environment
# variables. The --config flag is currently not fully implemented for loading these
# settings at runtime. If you run the service on a different port than 18181,
# you will need to update the URLs in config/exchanges/mock_v4.toml accordingly.

[run]
http_port = 18181
connector_instance_id = "mock-connector-1"
